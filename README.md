# ECON498_midterm

# Introduction

This code is meant for web scrapping two different websites. The websites are [coingecko](coingecko.com) and [coinmarketcap](coinmarketcap.com). Through these codes, you can gather live data for a period of time, and parse the data into datasets.

# Installation

# Usage and Steps

Simply put, the code is run in three steps.
`STEP 1`: Run the request codes for both websites at the same time.
`STEP 2`: Run the parse code for one website.
`STEP 3`: Run the parse code for the second website.

In order to run this code, open two terminals. Run `coingecko_request.py` in one terminal and `coinmarketcap_request.py` in the other. 
- It is important to note that these need to run at the same time in order to gather data from the websites close to the same time period. Without doing this, the data loses accuracy in true comparison.
